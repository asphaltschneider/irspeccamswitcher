# irspeccamswitcher
Tool for iRacing streamers with additional spectator view, that automagically switches through the cams.

## About
This tool is permanently in use by me and you can see it in action when I'm racing live
on https://twitch.tv/asphaltschneider

Feel free to get in touch with me for ideas and suggestions!

## Configuration
Fill in the ident of the driver inside the config file

Choose your desired cams for events that happen on track like
overtakes, battles etc.

## Requirements
For making this work, you need to run the server.exe from Kutu's
iRacing Browser Apps or Kapps.
